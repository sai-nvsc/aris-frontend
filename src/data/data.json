      "paragraph1": "Vaccination has undeniably been very beneficial in promoting a healthy global population. In terms of computational approaches, immunoinformatics systems such as ARIS have paved the way for a better understanding of the rabies virus. This could be a significant step forward in addressing a critical global health challenge per population.",
      "paragraph": "A.R.I.S (Anti-Rabies Immunoinformatics System) is a system that aims to provide anti-rabies immunization services to animal bite centers and other facilities that are legible to administer anti rabies vaccines in Taguig City. As a result, the system is solely capable of monitoring anti-rabies vaccines.",
